            <p>Smart Green is a comprehensive green house monitoring system that uses
                machine learning alongside clever engineering to maximize efficiency and
                minimize cost. With the installation of a few simple sensors, Smart Green can
                keep track of every measureable factor that can influence the performance of a
                greenhouse. It then uses machine learning while drawing from exsisting agricultural
                data to let the user know how their greenhouse is performing, and what it could
                be doing. It can give recommendations on where improvements can be made, while
                functioning as an all in one control system for the greenhouse, all in one place.
                For example, if Smart Green finds that the temperature of the greenhouse is too
                high for the crop being grown, it will alert the user of the issue, and from the
                application the user can initiate system cooling. Users of Smart Green find
                convenience , improved quality of life, and improvements to yield and quality.
